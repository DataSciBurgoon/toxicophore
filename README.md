#Toxicophore Prediction for Insensitive Munitions

The aim of this project was to use frequent itemset mining to identify chemical substructures that tend to predict toxicity. These substructures are called toxicophores. In this case, I wanted to predict acute aquatic toxicity in fathead minnows.

## An R-Based QSAR Approach
I used R to perform our QSAR. Every step that I performed to generate this report (the qsar\_analysis\_just\_the\_facts.html file) is in the qsar\_analysis\_just\_the_facts.Rmd file. I ran this in RStudio using R version 3.2.3. 

### Requirements
You'll need the following R libraries:

- arules
- ChemmineR
- ChemmineOB
- ggplot2
- arulesViz
- plotrix
- gdata
- caret
